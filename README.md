# Privacy_Preserving_StockExchange_SmartContract
This is a Solidiy code for a privacy-preserving Smart-contract.
For simplicity we assume that investors trade one type of share.

## To test the smart-contract:
1- Deploy the smart-contract to one of the Ethereum networks, or simply use Ganache.
2- Add anonymous investor accounts (CSD role) by calling addAnonymousNin () function
3- Simulate a trade by calling buyShares and sellShares function.
